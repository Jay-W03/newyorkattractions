      From luxurious restaurants to extravagant stores, New York City is the place to be. No matter what the season, there are an endless amount of things to do and see in New York.
      Here are a few places that will make your New York experience exceptional.</p></sub>

      <p id="statuetitle"><h3><center>1) Statue of Liberty:</h3></p></center>
      <p id= "statue"><sub>Let freedom ring! The Statue of Liberty was a gift from France to America during the American Revolution.
      This statue continues to be a symbol of liberty, freedom and hope today.
      While touring the Statue of Liberty, you have the option to stop by Ellis Island and look around the Immigration Museum. Many people
      wait for a ferry to carry them from Battery Park to Liberty Island where the statue is located.
      You can see NY’s skyline from the statue’s crown. Make sure to reserve your visit at least 3 weeks in advance.</p></sub>
